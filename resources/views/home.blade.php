                        <h2>What is Super 8</h2>
                        <p>Super 8 is music competition open to bands, composers, songwriters, bedroom producers - basically anyone who can create an origianl piece of music.</p>
                        <p>We have recorded a music video for your copmposition to be written and tracked to. Your entry will be judged not only on how good the tune is, however also on how well the song compliments the video and the story within.</p>
                        <p>The comp culminates with a live awards and performance evening at Sydney's Oxford Art Factory where the top, or 'Super' 8  nalists perform their tracks to a panel of industry heavy weights including artists, producers, sound engineers and label heads.</p>
                        <p>The comp is split into two categories, 'performance' and 'non performance'. Basically if you need a 24 piece orchestra to perform your track, or have electronically created a bunch of samples featuring a sped up humming bird or the sound of a catepillar crying you  t into the 'non performance' category.</p>

                        <h2>The Rules</h2>
                        <p>Your song must be an original composition.<br>
                        It cannot have been entered in another competition previously or used commercially.<br>
                        If you have written and recorded a song but not yet released it, this is your perfect opportunity!</p>
                        <p>This competition is about composing a piece of music to match a video.</p>
                        <p>Your composition must tell the story of the video. It must also be mixed, mastered &amp; synced to the video.</p>
